# 30-Days-Python-Learning-Challenge

Welcome to my 30-day Python coding challenge! I'm dedicating the next 30 days to learning Python and building a solid foundation. Every day, I‚Äôll be working on a new topic or concept and uploading my progress here.

## üìÖ Day 1: Introduction to Python & Strings

### ‚úÖ Topics Covered:
- What is Python?
- Setting up Python (installation & environment)
- Writing your first Python script: `print("Hello, World!")`
- Understanding variables and data types
- Introduction to strings
- String operations: concatenation, repetition, indexing, and slicing
- String methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`, `.find()`, etc.
- Basic input/output with strings

### üìù Notes:
- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
- Strings in Python are immutable sequences of characters enclosed in either single `'` or double `"` quotes.
- You can manipulate and analyze strings easily using built-in methods.
